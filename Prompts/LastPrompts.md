Got it ✅ — let’s turn your **Step 8.2** into a **series of small, precise prompts** you can feed to Qwen one by one.
This will let you easily check whether Qwen's MCP integration is working (by having it fetch info, read files, or use project context) while also moving the project forward.

***

## 📋 Chunked Prompt Set for Step 8.2

### **Section 1 – Testing Suite**

**Prompt 1.1 – Integration Tests**
> *“Using the project files, write a set of **integration tests** that exercise the complete Trading Journal workflow from data input through report generation. Keep tests modular and use our existing project structure.”*

**Prompt 1.2 – Performance Tests**
> *“Design performance tests to evaluate the application with large datasets (e.g., 1 million trade entries). Include dataset creation code, timing measurements, and performance thresholds. Ensure tests can be automated.”*

**Prompt 1.3 – Error Handling Tests**
> *“Write unit/integration tests focusing on error handling for all failure modes in the project. Cover network errors, file read/write issues, invalid data formats, missing configs, and user mistakes. Include expected error messages.”*

**Prompt 1.4 – User Experience Tests**
> *“Devise automated or semi-automated tests to validate user experience in the Streamlit interface. Simulate common user actions and check that UI flow matches intended design, with appropriate feedback messages.”*

***

### **Section 2 – Documentation**

**Prompt 2.1 – README Update**
> *“Update the project’s `README.md` to include: installation instructions for M1 Mac, virtual environment setup, MCP configuration for Zed/VS Code, usage examples, and deployment steps. Make it beginner-friendly.”*

**Prompt 2.2 – API Documentation**
> *“For every Python module and function in the project, generate API documentation with clear parameters, return values, and example calls. Use reStructuredText format for Sphinx compatibility.”*

**Prompt 2.3 – Streamlit User Guide**
> *“Create a user guide for the Streamlit interface detailing common workflows—data import, trade logging, analytics, and report export—with screenshots and tips.”*

**Prompt 2.4 – Config Options Doc**
> *“List all project configuration options with descriptions, default values, and example overrides. Include environment variables such as WORKSPACE_ROOT.”*

***

### **Section 3 – Deployment Setup**

**Prompt 3.1 – `requirements.txt`**
> *“Scan the project and generate an up-to-date `requirements.txt` including all dependencies required for testing, documentation, and deployment.”*

**Prompt 3.2 – Startup Script**
> *“Write a shell script `start.sh` that activates the `.venv`, starts the MCP server, and launches the Streamlit app. Include comments explaining each step.”*

**Prompt 3.3 – M1 Mac Deployment Notes**
> *“Detail the deployment steps for running the app on an Apple M1 Mac, including Homebrew setup, Python version management, and any architecture-specific flags.”*

**Prompt 3.4 – Environment Setup Instructions**
> *“Create step-by-step environment setup instructions for local development and deployment. Cover Python installation, venv creation, dependency installation, and MCP server config.”*

***

### **Section 4 – Implementation & Maintenance**

**Prompt 4.1 – Test Coverage Recap**
> *“List all components of the application and confirm they are covered by integration, performance, and error handling tests. Identify any untested areas.”*

**Prompt 4.2 – Troubleshooting Guide**
> *“Create a troubleshooting guide with common issues and fixes, including MCP/Zed connection errors, dependency problems, and Streamlit UI performance tips.”*

**Prompt 4.3 – Maintenance & Version Control**
> *“Write a section on ongoing version control and maintenance strategy—branch naming, commit style, release tagging, and update procedures.”*

***

### **Section 5 – Sample Data & Workflows**

**Prompt 5 – Example Dataset and Walkthrough**
> *“Generate a realistic sample trade dataset and create a step-by-step example workflow using it in the application, from import to report export. Include expected outputs.”*

## 🔍 How to Check if MCP is Being Used
When you feed Qwen these prompts:
1. **Watch your MCP server terminal** – you should see requests if Qwen is fetching files, reading configs, or running context tools.
2. If it suggests code that matches your actual filenames, logic, or configs — it’s likely pulling **real project context**.
3. If it’s generic and doesn’t reflect your actual repo, it might not be calling the MCP server, and you’ll need to adjust Zed’s config or check logs.

If you want, I can also prepare these as a **single structured checklist file** so you can paste them into Zed in sequence and tick off each one as Qwen completes it — that would make this last step nearly automatic.

Do you want me to prepare that ready-to-run checklist for you?
