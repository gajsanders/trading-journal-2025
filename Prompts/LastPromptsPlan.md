To ensure Qwen (your local model) uses your MCP server effectively for the final Step 8.2 of your project, break down your prompt and validation into manageable chunks. This approach lets you test and verify Qwen’s output piece by piece, ensuring correctness and MCP integration at each step.

## Step-by-step Breakdown for Qwen with MCP Server Integration

### 1. Testing Suite Creation (Integration, Performance, Error Handling, UX)
- **Chunk 1.1:**
  Ask Qwen to generate integration test cases covering your trading journal’s core workflows.
  *Check:* Are the tests complete and encompass multi-step flows?

- **Chunk 1.2:**
  Request performance tests focusing on large dataset handling.
  *Check:* Does the output include setup for large sample data, benchmarks, or metrics?

- **Chunk 1.3:**
  Ask for error handling tests covering possible failure modes.
  *Check:* Are all edge cases and exceptions accounted for with meaningful messages?

- **Chunk 1.4:**
  Request user experience (UX) tests simulating typical user interactions.
  *Check:* Are common user scenarios and UI flows tested?

### 2. Documentation Preparation
- **Chunk 2.1:**
  Generate updated `README.md` content with installation and usage instructions.
  *Check:* Verify clarity, completeness, and accuracy.

- **Chunk 2.2:**
  Produce API documentation for every module and function.
  *Check:* Is the documentation detailed and structured (e.g., docstrings or Sphinx style)?

- **Chunk 2.3:**
  Ask for a user guide focused on the Streamlit interface specifics.
  *Check:* Ensure it covers how to use UI components and common workflows.

- **Chunk 2.4:**
  Request configuration options documentation, covering environment variables and settings.
  *Check:* Are options clearly explained with defaults and usage?

### 3. Deployment Setup
- **Chunk 3.1:**
  Update or regenerate `requirements.txt` with all project dependencies.
  *Check:* Are all pip packages listed accurately?

- **Chunk 3.2:**
  Create an easy startup script (e.g., `start.sh` or Python launcher).
  *Check:* Does it activate the virtual environment and launch the app smoothly?

- **Chunk 3.3:**
  Generate deployment configuration or notes tailored for Apple M1 Mac architecture.
  *Check:* Is it optimized or adjusted for M1-specific instructions?

- **Chunk 3.4:**
  Add environment setup instructions covering everything needed before running the app locally.
  *Check:* Are steps clear and reproducible?

### 4. Overall Implementation & Maintenance
- **Chunk 4.1:**
  Confirm that all components are tested and error messages are user-friendly.
  *Check:* Review outputs mentioning test coverage and UX with error guidance.

- **Chunk 4.2:**
  Request troubleshooting guide content for common issues.
  *Check:* Does it support users fixing environment or runtime problems?

- **Chunk 4.3:**
  Ask for version control best practices and maintenance suggestions.
  *Check:* Includes branching strategy, commit messages, and update policies.

### 5. Sample Data and Example Workflows
- **Chunk 5:**
  Generate sample datasets and create example workflows demonstrating typical usage.
  *Check:* Are data diverse and workflows clear, from start to finish?

## How to Check Qwen’s MCP Usage in Each Chunk

For each chunk:

1. **Trigger Qwen with the chunk prompt**, sent via your MCP server interface.
2. **Inspect Qwen’s output** for:
   - Relevant, coherent, and complete responses.
   - References or usage of MCP tools if applicable (e.g., file reads or configs fetched dynamically).
3. **If output lacks context or detail, check MCP server logs** to confirm that Zed + Qwen queried your MCP server correctly.
4. **Iterate and refine the chunk prompts** if needed to coax better responses or deeper MCP tool use.

## Summary of Steps to Proceed

| Step                  | Action                                         | Validation                           |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1.1 - 1.4             | Request testing plans chunk by chunk             | Check for completeness & relevance |
| 2.1 - 2.4             | Ask documentation pieces in sections             | Clarity and coverage of content     |
| 3.1 - 3.4             | Generate deployment files and instructions       | Accuracy and platform compatibility |
| 4.1 - 4.3             | Validate error handling & maintenance docs       | User guidance and maintenance tips  |
| 5                     | Create sample data + workflow scenarios           | Practical examples and usable data  |

After each step, confirm MCP server communication by checking Zed's Assistant logs and Qwen's dynamic context usage.
